![](https://i.imgur.com/GyIuTI4.jpg)

Since the old developer of AlphaNode had left the project. He had removed GitHub, shut down the website, blockchain explorer and disappeared from all social networks. 

Then, the Alphanode community had decided to take over the project. Our objective is to make Alphanode be the community-driven cryptocurrency for everyone. 

After hard work for several weeks, we glad to announce that a new AlphaNode version 3.0.0.3  is released. This version had fixed unstable issue of the previous 
version and prepare for fork process to change the specification.
