### Digital currency for the real world â€“ the fast and free way to pay for everything in life.

#### Instant transactions   -   Zero fees   -   Infinitely scalable

Nano, formerly RaiBlocks (XRB), using its own block-lattice structure, wants to succeed where Bitcoin has fallen short. It promises to deliver zero-fee transactions in real time without the same work-intensive overhead and energy consumption as Bitcoin. Like IOTA, Nano uses a Directed acyclic graph (DAG), but instead of using DAG for the tangle, Nano employs its own novel tech called the "block-lattice".

Nano's mission is to become a global currency with instantaneous transactions and zero fees over a secure, decentralized network.


#### Use-cases:

- Ideal Trading Pair: Nano's instant and zero-fee transactions make it ideal for cryptocurrency traders.
- Peer to Peer: Quickly pay friends and family using Nano, whether you're paying rent, or splitting a taxi fare or bill.
- Micropayments: Use Nano to pay small amounts for digital asset rights, content subscriptions and more.
- Business to Customer: Seamless checkouts are right around the corner with Nano, whether in store or online.
