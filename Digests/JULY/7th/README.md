Qyno is a cryptocurrency based project designed to 
provide financial services on blockchain technology.

The mission of Qyno is to bring the digital world of cryptocurrency closer to the real world. 
Stretching further the innovation in the cryptocurrency world, Qyno (QNO) embeds anonymous characteristics 
with nearly no-cost transactions and grants businesses the capability to trade different assets and goods 
in a secure manner reacing their ambitious financial objectives.


#### Qyno Project

Qyno project's goal is the development of tools and products that can allow everyone acces to faster, safer, anonymous, and near-zero cost financial products and services. Having meticulously studied and tested existing blockchain-based financial products and networks, we created Qyno with the aim of becoming a reference in the blockchain financial services sector after concluding that others fail to deliver on the goals which are our vision.

Predecessors are meant to be learned from and eventually overcome. If this weren't the case, we would still be stuck with Friendster for social networking or Napster for peer-to-peer sharing. Bitcoin may be just such a predecessor, yet there isn't enough being done in the blockchain space to move beyond its slow transaction times and exorbitant fees.

The core of the Qyno Project is Qyno Coin (QNO), a digital currency based on the latest blockchain technology and network architecture created go beyond Bitcoin by providing seamless, instant, and low cost transactions secured by masternodes.

#### Qyno - Trading Made Easy on the Blockchain

From the outset, the pillar of the Qyno project will be the QYNO coin, a utility coin with two aims. First, the QYNO coin will function as a stable asset enabling the development of the project's ecosystem. Second, the QYNO coin will reward masternode operators with industry-leading ROI, as masternode operators will earn a generous passive income due to a staggering 90% block reward. The purpose of such a mammoth block reward is to create a very high incentive for masternode operators working to secure the network.

The QYNO coin's stability will allow users to engage the Qyno financial system easily. Without major fluctuations in price affecting the net cost of users looking to enter and use the Qyno financial system, adoption of the system will happen quickly and globally. The entry into and use of blockchain-based financial systems tend to be 
prohibitive, due in part to the fact that the utility coins associated with those financial systems fluctuate wildly in value, making cost analysis for users looking to enter the system difficult to calculate.
