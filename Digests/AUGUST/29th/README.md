#### INTRODUCTION 

Electronero Pulse  (ETNXP:)  

Electronero Pulse is  a  fork  from  Electronero  (ETN)  made  by  the  community,  for  the  community beginning building from Monero source v0.12.2 Lithium Luna, one of the most respectable cryptocurrency well-known for security, privacy, untraceability and active development. Starting as an educational project, we found that it would be great to create a new coin with high level of privacy by (1) moving forward right away to Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT), (2) setting minimum transaction mixins to 12 that would make it high resistance to blockchain analysis attacks..  We found that some of the features of Sumokoin were also interesting to us such as the "bitcoin-like" Camel emission, rather than a traditional Elliptical emission curve. So we implemented that. We also adapted the LWMA as we were advised by mathematician and blockchain theorist Zawy has researched this new difficulty algorithm extensively. Public Testnet launch is debuted at block height 280,000. The hard fork  will occur at block height  307,000  and  all  owners  of  Electroneum  will  be  de  facto  owners  of  Electronero.  The  codebase  for  this  project  is  the  Monero Lithium Luna v0.12.2+ release  core  code  to  which  a  lot  of  modifications  are  being  made  in  order  to  provide  a  better,  more  reliable  platform  to  current, past Electroneum and future Electronero  users. 


#### BASIS  FOR THE HARD  FORK 

Electronero core developers will begin by updating to fix ETNX supply, rewards, network fees. As a result of a world wide caucus held between the electronero core team. 19 members from different parts of the globe were selected as team after participating in volunteer conributions to the Electronero community. The internal reorganization brings with it some discussions and many votes were cast. The votes were split and two coins will be formed from the upcoming hard fork, which we will announce on BitcoinTalk at or around block 407,001. ETNX will survive a new birth. ETNXP, a segregated alternative and mineable token with chain specific parameters and a common goal will be formed on the Electronero blockchain. Estimated date of arrival for the hard fork is August 30th, 2018 in about two weeks, or 14 days. Meanwhile Electronero first Smart Node contract will be deployed soon to the mobile application, bear with us during development on that as we are rushing new features to market. Electronero core team will maintain both coins. ETNX coin will focus its usages to Smart Contracts and Mobile development, Applications, while the new Electronero smart node token ETNXP will be dedicated for Gaming, and Bounty. Any participating ETNX will be transferrable to ETNXP in 1:1 ratio for ETNX coins held in Electronero mobile wallet application or on TradeOgre.com ETNX wallets. We have support from Excoincial and TradeOgre at this time.  Stay tuned! 

**Supply & Emission**


Total supply ETNXP: 100,000,000,000 ETNXP token supply after the hard fork.

Coin symbol: ETNXP

Coin units:


electroneropulse = 1.00000000 ETNXP

tokenXP = 0.10000000 ETNXP

omegaXP = 0.01000000 ETNXP

alphaXP = 0.00100000 ETNXP

karmaXP = 0.00010000 ETNXP

shiftXP = 0.00001000 ETNXP

electronero = 0.00000100 ETNXP

noXP = 0.00000010 ETNXP



**Hash algorithm:** CryptoNight_MSR (CN_FAST, cn_variant 4)


**Block time:** 60 seconds



**Emission scheme: **Electronero Pulse's block reward changes every 6-months following a "Camel" distribution (inspired by real-world mining production like of crude oil, coal etc. that is often slow at first, accelerated in the next few years before declined and depleted). However, the emission path of Electronero is generally not far apart from that of Sumokoin.

#### Features

- Secure and private
- Designed for mass adoption
- User-friendly
- Professional Network
- No more expensive fees

#### MOBILE MULTI WALLET & ELECTRONERO PARKING 
With Electronero Mobile you can manage your ETNX/ETNXP anywhere. 
Anyone with a smartphone and an internet connection can receive ETNX/ETNXP and earn bonus for parking ETNX/ETNXP with Electronero parking.

The Electronero mobile wallet is on Android and iOS.


#### CAMEL EMISSIONS
With ETNXP miners can count on the block reward. 

#### TRUE FUNGIBILITY

Electronero is one of a few rare cryptocurrencies with true fungibility - the feature makes digital currency act like physical cash i.e. no other people can find where the money comes from and how many have been transferred.

#### GREAT PRIVACY

Electronero is created with high level of privacy in mind, setting Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) with minimum ringsize of 12(+1) to conceal sources/amounts transferred and make it high resistance to blockchain-analysis attacks

#### STRONG SECURITY
Electronero utilizes the power of a distributed peer-to-peer consensus network, every transaction is cryptographically secured. Individual accounts have a 26 word mnemonic seed displayed when created, which can be written down to back up the account and account files are encrypted with a passphrase to ensure they are worthless if stolen.


#### Additional Specifications

As we prepare for the upcoming hard fork we must add important parameters to the API and secure the blockchain from double spend attack. The network is poised for growth and our recent updates were successful in production. We're implementing new technology in our full stack mobile application, known as zk-PARKS, which will be the technology behind the usages of Electronero parking and Electronero smart contracts. This is the best way I can describe zk-PARKS is in the implementation behind the voting methods employed during the use of electronero smart contracts and parking powered by zero knowledge proofs theory. Through the use of zero-knowledge proofs, a method by which one party (the prover Bob) can prove to another party (the verifier Alice) that she knows a value x, without conveying any information apart from the fact that she knows the value x. Something otherwise concealed through cryptography. Many parties may be involved through participation in public groups. In the example, only Bob and Alice have proof.

In our example, Bob the Founder orders contract, and receives zero knowledge proof. Receives a contract profile with a link to invite participants. Many users join and have the opportunity to interact with the Contract. Knowing that it's an environment built around zero-knowledge proofs only Bob and Alice would know if Bob or Alice participated in the contract through verifiable blockchain proof.

The acronym zk-PARKS stands for “Zero-Knowledge Private Interactive Argument of Knowledge,” and refers to a proof construction where one can prove possession of certain information, e.g. a secret key, without revealing that information, and without any interaction between the prover and verifier.

#### Electronero Pulse is Based on CryptoNote Technology
#### What is CryptoNote?
CryptoNote is the technology that allows creation of privacy-centric cryptocurrencies. You can visit their website at cryptonote.org. The level of anonymity provided by CryptoNote isn't possible with Bitcoin code base by design. Bytecoin (BCN) was the CryptoNote reference implementation, and Monero (XMR) based their sources on BCN. Electronero Pulse (ETNXP) is based on XMR's code.

Two of the main features of CryptoNote are ring signatures that mask sender identities by mixing and one-time keys that make transactions unlinkable. Their combined effect gives a high degree of anonymity without any extra effort on the part of the user.

Unlike Bitcoin, your funds are not held in the address you give out to others. Instead, every time you receive a payment it goes to an unlinkable address generated with random numbers. When you decide to spend the funds in that one-time address, the amount will be broken down and the components will be indistinguishable from identical outputs in the blockchain.

For example if 556.44 ETNXP are sent, the protocol will break it down into 500 + 50 + 6 + 0.4 + 0.04 and a ring signature will be performed with other 500's, 50's, 6's, 0.4's, and 0.04's in the blockchain. Unlike the "CoinJoin" mixing method, CryptoNote mixes outputs not transactions. This means no other senders need to be participating with you at the same time or with the same amounts. Any arbitrary amount sent at any time can always be rendered fundamentally indistinguishable (a mathematical proof is given in the white paper).

The degree of anonymity is also a choice rather than decided by the protocol: do you want to be hidden as one among five or one among fifty? The size of the signature grows linearly as O(n+1) with the ambiguity so greater anonymity is paid for with higher fees to miners.

Ring signatures are explained below. Reproduced from CryptoNote:

A normal signature looks like this. There's only one participant, which allows one-to-one mapping.

A ring signature obscures identities because it only proves that a signer belongs to a group.

This allows a high level of anonymity in cryptocurrency transactions. You can think of it as decentralized and trustless mixing.

#### How does this compare to other anonymous solutions?
Ring signatures originate from the work of Rivest et al. in 2001 and the implementation in CryptoNote relies in particular on Fujisaki and Suzuki's work on traceable ring signatures. There are two other anonymity implementations currently available or in development. One is ZeroCoin/ZeroCash's use of zero-knowledge proofs. The others are based on gmaxwell's CoinJoin idea (such as mixing services for Bitcoin or the altcoin Darkcoin).

##### 1. Comparison with ZeroCoin and ZKP-based approaches:
You can read about ZeroCoin and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) here. The ZK environment allows an anonymity set that includes everyone in the network because the validity of an output can be proven without knowing the corresponding public key until it is spent. The largest risk is that this is recent research-level cryptography that hasn't been subjected to years of cryptanalysis, so exploits may emerge down the road. Ring signatures are much simpler and more mature, with many peer-reviewed papers published over more than a decade.

Other issues with ZKP include the RSA private key used to initiate the accumulator, which must be trusted to be destroyed by the generating party. It also obscures the entire economy, not just sender/receiver identities. If the ZK system is compromised, then an attacker can continuously spend coins that don't exist using false proofs. This damage is hidden from everybody due to total blinding and consequently at any given time it's not possible to know if the network has already been compromised. There is a tradeoff between these inherent risks and the maximal anonymity set provided by ZKP. CryptoNote aims for a different balance through the dual layers of privacy provided by one-time keys and ring signatures.

##### 2. Comparison with CoinJoin-based approaches:
XMR is more qualitatively similar to mixing implementations like CoinJoin. The differences arise in the departure from the Bitcoin protocol, which allows ETNXP to use new cryptography to provide decentralized and trustless mixing of superior quality. The critical problem with mixing services is the need to trust the operators. As an example, blockchain.info's mixer gives the following disclaimer: "However if the server was compromised or under subpoena it could be force to keep logs. If this were to happen although you haven't gained any privacy you haven't lost any either."

The CoinJoin-inspired Darkcoin performs mixing with selected "masternodes" since it still uses ordinary signatures that can be mapped one-to-one. The motivation is that a randomly selected node is less likely than a single service to exhibit bad faith (such as keeping logs) . In practice, a few VPS companies host the vast majority of nodes and this approach relies on the integrity and good behavior of these nodes. ETNXP's more fundamental cryptographic approach doesn't have these vulnerabilities and the quality of anonymity is much higher.

ETNX's ring signatures are also far more secure and convenient than CoinJoin because they mix outputs not transactions. This means a transaction doesn't involve waiting around for other senders to mix with. Nor is a user restricted to mixing only if others are sending the same amount. Arbitrary amounts can be sent at any time without anyone else's participation. This feature makes a timing analysis of the blockchain useless.

#### Overview of a transaction
Bob decides to spend an output, which was sent to the one-time public key. He needs Extra (1), TxOutNumber (2), and his Account private key (3) to recover his one-time private key (4).

When sending a transaction to Carol, Bob generates its Extra value by random (5). He uses Extra (6), TxOutNumber (7) and Carol's Account public key (Cool to get her Output public key (9).

In the input Bob hides the link to his output among the foreign keys (10). To prevent double-spending he also packs the Key image, derived from his One-time private key (11).

Finally, Bob signs the transaction, using his One-time private key (12), all the public keys (13) and Key Image (14). He appends the resulting Ring Signature to the end of the transaction (15).
