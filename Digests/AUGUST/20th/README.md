Our Team is excited to introduce you Ethlus - the first service where you can sell your cryptocurrency higher than its market value! 

To sell coins above the real price - it may sound ridiculous, but itâ€™s absolutely real. 
Howâ€™s that possible? The thing is at Ethlus you can sell cryptocurrencies in a draw format. 
Are you eager to learn more? 

Then read the details on how it works.


Letâ€™s say you have 1000 XRP you wish to sell. The market value of 1000 XRP is 1.12925 ETH. However, through our service, you can sell your currency up to 4 times higher its real value. So, you can offer your Ripples, for example, for 3 ETH.

Next, you choose the draw type.

1. The Normal Draw is held anyway at the end of the period you specify. If you set a one-week period, your 1000 XRP will be drawn between all the participants in 7 days exactly, no matter if 3 ETH is collected or not. 

2. The Safety Draw is held only if 3 ETH is collected, otherwise, you receive back your XRP while all other participants receive back ETH theyâ€™ve invested. If you choose the Safety Draw you should pay a small commission fee (e.g. 7% of 1000 XRP, that equals 70 XRP).

The winner is drawn at random through a Smart contract, but you can select the winner choose mode.

1)  Bid dependent. The more a participant invests, the higher his chances of winning are. 


- A invests 1 ETH
- B invests 1 ETH
- C invests 0.5 ETH
- D invests 0.5 ETH

Hence the probability of winning is â…“  for A and B and  â…™ for C and D. 
2) Bid independent. All the participants have equal chances of winning regardless of the invested amount. 

- A invests 1 ETH
- B invests 1 ETH
- C invests 0.5 ETH
- D invests 0.5 ETH

In this case, the probability of winning is Â¼ for everyone - A, B, C, D.

Once the draw is over, we transfer the collected ETH to the seller except for a certain commission fee and the won cryptocurrency to the winner. 


The draw of Ethereum is held through a Smart contract. This means itâ€™s absolutely transparent, so you can monitor every step - from the very beginning till the moment the winning is transferred to the winner. 

We hold all other cryptocurrencies till the end of the draw; then they are automatically transferred to the winner. 
 
The user who has launched the draw gets the collected amount to his ETH wallet.

Do we support mobile devices?  

Unfortunately no. Our project requires the installation of MetaMask, therefore itâ€™s impossible to launch a draw or to participate in the already existing one via a mobile device.
