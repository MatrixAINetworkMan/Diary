### WHAT IS RENTLEDGER?

Rentledger is the blockchain-based system that rewards for logging your rental payments and history, providing a secure, anonymous and easily verifiable source of independent information.

### OUR GOAL AND VISION


To enable all users to effectively take total and decentralized control of all of their rental records, placing the power of information back into the hands of the individual.


### CURRENT PROBLEM IN THE INDUSTRY



The increasing centralized nature of our financial institutions and authorities has renters forced to place total faith in third parties. Dependence on the centralized payment methods and associated records places users of the system in a required trust relationship and all management firmly in the hands of the corporation, not the individual or community.

### WHY RENTLEDGER
