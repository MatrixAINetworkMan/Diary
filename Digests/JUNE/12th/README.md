## [ANN][AIQ] Artiqox - Blockchain Intelligence - AuxPoW


### Artiqox - Blockchain Intelligence

##### The Vision

A.I. stands for Artificial Intelligence, which is going to be everywhere and there will be more and more development around this technology. Our lives will be highly influenced by A.I. in ways beyond imagination. Similar changes that we experienced with Internet, smartphones and blockchain technologies.

By todays standards A.I. is already being used by many IT companies to evolve their products. By implementing A.I. into a blockchain we see a new future. The blockchain technology is on the rise in a similar way as PCs and Internet technology were in the 1980s and 1990s respectively. No one imagined holding more computational power in hand than was present in Apollo 11 or having gigabit connections available for each home.

##### About

Artiqox (AIQ) is the name of our project. AIQ is not just a single application or implementation in the blockchain world, AIQ is a whole ecosystem.

AIQ wants to become one of the largest innovation centers worldwide. As a mentoring platform for existing companies as well as for completely inexperienced startups, we would like to take up the challenge and set innovative and new standards in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

We will only be able to gain competitive advantage by working closely with our clients and the industry and by adapting AIQ to the needs, wishes and challenges of AI-based products and services.

The increasing networking across different sectors and countries is reflected in the increasing digital networking of the economy. So are production, service and procurement processes are becoming increasingly digitized.

The resulting insight is that we are in a structural change. Future oriented and above all, competitive companies and especially governments have to deal with the topic of artificial intelligence. At governmental level, strategies for dealing with and promoting ‘intelligent machines’ must be developed.

There is a lot to catch up to because watching various industries or just by reading the press alone, we quickly realizes that in some countries there is a massive lack of awareness about artificial intelligence.

Through AIQ we want to connect companies and start-ups with the science of blockchain / Tangle technology. AIQ wants to be the initiator, with the goal of “symbiosis”.

The main functions of the Artiqox ecosystem can be divided into three main pillars, but in all areas are the continuation of business activities under unforeseen difficult conditions is always the target. We would like to emphasize that an open and in all business areas innovative, purpose oriented usability has the highest goal for us.

We are a nexus of modern technology and art. A project meant for the creative people. For the people born to dream and inspire. For those who want to break free from the bureaucracy and social limits of the busy world. 

In this world, the creative ones regularly collide with the lack of proper working conditions. Payment issues are common, while really interesting and challenging orders are hard to come by. Requests to redo the work due to random changes of plans/mood of the contractor add to the everyday stress. So do the questions of intellectual property management. From the side of a contractor, in turn, it is quite hard to find a specialist who can fulfill the order really good, and to negotiate mutual and transparent terms of contract. There’s always a risk that a freelancer will be lost from radar after he receives his prepayment. Or that the job will be done carelessly.

Despite the fact that a host of services like freelance.com have existed for quite a time, both parties have difficulties in finding each other. The problems of search, quality control, reliability and trust have not gone anywhere. Aiming to solve these problems and optimize the communication between the Artist and the Contractor, we have designed an ecosystem that would allow fruitful and comfortable interaction - the world for the Creative, filled with Innovations - meet CIC, the Creative Innovations Coin!
