###### Token swap: from ROAR to Angry Panda

A token swap could take place after the Round 10 or also before: for every ROAR token owned, you’ll receive an Angry Panda token. This process will be really simple: you’ll find the new pair ROAR/Angry Panda on Waves DEX to change all your ROAR tokens at a 1:1 rate. We will be announcing the start time of the token swap through announcement.


###### Token swap: from Waves to ERC20

We are planning also for a possible token swap from Waves to ERC20 or the creation of the same coin for dual-blockchain project (the existance on both the Waves and Ethereum blockchains). You may trade, buy or hold on to your current Waves-based tokens as usual without the need to do anything special at this time. We will be releasing a full instruction guide in future on how the process regarding the move from Waves to ERC20 will work.
