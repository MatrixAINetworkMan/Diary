## [WVP] WAVEPAY / POW / POS / MASTERNODE / LAUNCH JUNE 5, 2018

LAUNCH DATE JUNE 5, 2018 3:00:00 PM



Proof of work (POW) provides a simple algorithm that allows network
nodes to vote or verify some updates of the Bitcoin ledger and allows a free
entry to this process to solve the problem of who gets to influence the
consensus with preventing attacks.

POW alternates a formal barrier to participation, such as each single
node power in the verifying process is depending on the computing power
that the node brings.

After that, problem of huge power and electricity fees began to
appear in order to continue working with the proof of work, which led to a
new alternative approach called proof of stake.

Proof of Stake (POS) is an approach that works through calculating
the weight of a node according to its currency staking or holding only,
which means more power and electricity saving. These two approaches,
proof of work and proof of stake can be used for any Cryptocurrency.
Each Transaction is being placed using a wallet (Linux wallet, Windows
wallet, IOS Wallet, or Mobile Wallet) as a block in the Blockchain in order to
be verified or voted among the nodes in the network, that is the Miners’
work in the Proof of Work and Stakers’ work in the Proof of stake.
Transactions can be processed in less time depending on many
people interested in mining and staking, allowing computers to verify
nodes in the network so as to gain some profits, those verifying
nodes make the network alive as long as there are active nodes in
the peer to peer network.


### MAIN FEATURES:

1. Darksend

PrivateSend (DarkSend) is a coin-mixing service based on CoinJoin, with numerous modifications. 
These include using masternodes instead of a single website, chaining by mixing with multiple masternodes, 
restricting the mixing to only accept certain denominations (e.g.: 0.01 WVP, 0.1 WVP, 1 WVP, and 10 WVP, etc.), and passive mode. 

The maximum allowed for a PrivateSend transaction is 1000 WVP.

Later iterations used a more advanced method of pre-mixing denominations 
built into the user's cryptocurrency wallet. 

The implementation of PrivateSend also allows masternodes to submit the 
transactions using special network code called DSTX,
this provides additional privacy to users due to the deadchange issue present in 
other CoinJoin based implementations such as DarkWallet and CoinShuffle.

In its current implementation it adds privacy to transactions by combining identical inputs
 from multiple users into a single transaction with several outputs. 

Due to the identical inputs, transactions usually cannot be directly traced, 
obfuscating the flow of funds. 

PrivateSend makes WAVEPAY by mixing the coins in the same
denomination with other wallets, ensuring that all coins are of the same value.
Simply put, Darksend is a service that allows you to make your payment anonymous. 
But for this service you have to pay the fee.

2. Masternode.

Masternodes are nodes running the same wallet software on the 
same blockchain to provide extra services to the network. These 
services include coin mixing for increased privacy of transactions, 
instant transactions and a decentralized governance that provides 
a decentralized budgeting system with immutable proposal and 
voting systems.

For providing such services, masternodes are also paid a certain 
portion of reward for each block. This can serve as a passive 
income to the masternode owners minus their running cost.

To promote an even ratio between staking nodes and 
masternodes in the network, the WAVEPAY team has developed a 
variable Reward Balance System that dynamically adjusts 
its block reward size between MINER, masternodes and staking nodes.

The logic is simple in its roots. The higher the masternode count, 
the smaller the reward portion of each PoW & PoS block that will be 
paid out to the masternodes and the larger the reward portion 
for staking nodes. Conversely, when the masternode count falls, 
the masternode reward portion is increased and the staking node 
reward portion decreased.

The PoW & PoS block reward starts with a ratio of 50% to 50% towards 
masternodes.
