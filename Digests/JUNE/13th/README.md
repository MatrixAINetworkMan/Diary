### üôã Introduction

Less than half of Argentina's population have access to secure funds storage and online payments services. The Buenos Ecosystem is here to solve the problem, by partnering the UK's leading BTClockchain company with Argentina's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. 

Access to convenient financial infrastructure is limited in Argentina. Economic prosperity cannot be fully realized until the Argentinian public have access to secure fund management and transactional tools, that provide a user-friendly, widely-adopted solution. The problem is that Argentina's current financial tools are limited, with a great barrier to entry. For Argentina's people and economy to flourish they need a wealth storage and payment system, on which they can trust and rely. The system is required to be accessible to all people in Argentina, with minimum barrier to entry.  Buenos is a mobile-friendly cryptocurrency designed to cater to the needs of the Argentinian people and economy. Buenos Mobile is intuitively designed to provide a seamless user-experience that quickly feels familiar to anyone, regardless of their background.

### ‚úÖ Here is the Solution

The structure of the Buenos ecosystem relies on 3 core principles. These core principles have been established to ensure the most effective adoption of Buenos in Argentina. The genesis of these principles is derived from the requirements of the Argentinian people and economy. By implementing these principles, the Buenos core team is ensuring trust, scalability, transparency and usability of the Buenos ecosystem. By starting with facilitating fund storage and transactions for the unbanked, and early investment in the cryptocurrency space, Buenos has a platform by which the Buenos ecosystem can be adopted as the mainstream form of payments in Argentina. 

1. Establish a fair consensus method for issuance (100% APoW Mining).


2. Issuance of a responsive, minimum-fee cryptocurrency by establishing a global partnership between the most trusted local Argentinian exchange (SouthXchange) and leading BTClockchain company OBC.


3. Continuous development of open source finance tools by Online Blockchain, catering to the evolving needs/requirements of the Argentinian people and economy.

Buenos is a 100% Adaptive Proof of Work (APoW) cryptocurrency. The design of its mining protocol is based on two critical requirements:

1. APoW Fair Mining.
2. Resistance to Hash Attack of any kind.

APoW Fair mining is achieved with a combination of the rare, ASIC Resistant HMQ1725 algorithm, and the thoughtful configuration of the block time, and block difficulty retarget time. By enabling the blockchain to quickly adapt to changes in network hash-rate (Every 5 Minutes), miners who wish to orchestrate a hash attack, have at most a 5 minute window of advantage. When compared to the configuration of bitcoin and altcoins with similar configurations, attacks of the same nature would present a window of advantage for up to 2 weeks, before the network could adapt to the change in network hashrate.

The HMQ1725 algorithm favours personal computers, and is unfavourable to miners with huge output. It is therefore less attractive to strip miners who would attack the network and dump the coins.

### üí≤ Buenos is Backed Against Bitcoin

10% of the coins mined with APoW will be stored in a special price stability fund. These coins will be issued through SouthXchange. Half of the bitcoin raised through this issuance will be used to back the price of Buenos against bitcoin. This will support the guaranteed 0% mining fee for the life of Buenos while stabilizing the price. The Buenos ecosystem takes a strong stance against an ICO, and will instead take a premine of the Buenos coin. 5% of the total Volume of Buenos will be sold into bitcoin in the first year, half of which will be backed against the price of Buenos and ensure long term stability and growth. Online Blockchain is a leading global blockchain and finance company, publicly listed in the UK. They will provide continuous development to meet the every-changing requirements of Argentina's people and economy. They will take a 15% premine of the total volume of the coin, which includes a continuous bounty campaign to promote interest and innovation on the platform. Most of the premine will be issued back into the community through SouthXchange issuance and the bounty campaign

Online Blockchain will provide the globe's leading blockchain developers for the Buenos Core Team, and the infrastructure required to orchestrate such a large-scale project. They strive to guarantee the future of the Buenos Ecosystem.
