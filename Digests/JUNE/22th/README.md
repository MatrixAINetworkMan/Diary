Our technology was internationally recognized and was listed on the UNEP list in 2000 under the title 
"Papusha Rocket Technology" or PRT. PRT was created to eliminate highly toxic waste, that’s why we can 
use it in one the most profitable market – oil industry and refinery.

Small-sized PRT-2 processing unit uses the contents of such ponds as raw materials. 
Oil residues are processed at high temperature (more than 1,0000 С) at transonic speeds (~1,000 m/sec) 
by adding special impurities. Under such conditions, the processed substances undergo radical physico-chemical 
changes, most of which turn into synthetic gas. Further, the substance enters the cooling unit, where a useful 
product is synthesized (kerosene, gasoline, oil, etc.). In this case harmless water vapor and carbon dioxide 
are delineated into the atmosphere. The valuable raw materials obtained in an environmentally friendly manner 
are accumulated in special tanks that are ready for further transportation and sale.


##### The use and prospects of the PRT token for investors

To understand the value of the PRT token, as well as the prospects for its growth, it is necessary to collect all necessary data.

The PRT-2 unit with the smallest power is taken as a basis:

•   The cost price – USD 450,000,

•   The sale price – USD 950,000

•   Net profit from one PRT unit – USD 500,000.


This unit recycles 30 tons of residues per day. Taking into account the required maintenance, 
the unit works on average 250 days a year. The annual processing of residues is 7,500 tons.

Every day refineries generate 1.35 million tons of residues worldwide or 500 million tons annually. 
Thus, as estimated, it is necessary to have about 70,000 PRT-2 units.

The company has created a simple token binding that is understandable for investors, with a continuous growth potential. 

For each PRT-2 unit sold, 15% of the sales amount goes to the “liquidity fund”. 

The company undertakes to transfer this amount from the liquidity fund 
for the purchase of tokens from the market and burn them within the next 3 months (since the sale).

Example:

15% of USD 950,000 is USD 142,500. 

This does not affect the company’s work, taking into account the net profit from every sold unit in the amount of USD 500,000. 

From each sale $142,500 is sent to the liquidity fund.

The total number of tokens in the amount of 100 million is USD 10,000,000.

The price of the token (this value is used to simplify calculations) is $0.1.

Thus, selling 6,200 PRT-2 units for 3 years, which is only slightly more than 7% of the market’s needs, we will send 
USD 883 million to buy tokens from the exchange and increase its price supposedly 3,000 times.
