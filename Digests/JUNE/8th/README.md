### 0xcert - Your ID, degree, artwork or house. 0xcert-ified on the blockchain.

![](https://i.imgur.com/DKv6Flr.png)

Create, own, and validate unique assets on the blockchain with 0xcert - the first open protocol built to support the future of digital assets, powered by non-fungible tokens.

The 0xcert protocol offers tools for building powerful dapps, aimed at easy authentication and management of digital or real-world tangible assets (such as ID, degree, in-game item or a house) on the blockchain. 0xcert is the first open protocol for issuing, verifying and managing unique digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain.

### WHY US AND WHY NOW? 

The vision of 0xcert is to provide an open protocol for non-fungible tokens to a wider tech audience.

Blockchain was first built for the financial capital; now it is ready to take on unique digital and real-world assets. With use of non-fungible tokens the idea of storing intangible assets such as copyrights, patents and goodwill, as well as tangible asset ownership such as property, equipment and inventory is now possible like never before.

### WHAT PROBLEMS ARE WE SOLVING?

Slow adoption of NFTs, lack of interoperability, costly and slow development of NFT applications, no mechanism to verify authentic issuers.

Due to low-level blockchain complexity, the wide adoption of non-fungible tokes and blockchain in general is slower than it could be. The lack of conventions prevents interoperability among applications. Developers trying to develop their own decentralised application using non-fungible tokens face long development time and huge risk in their development process and security, lowering the overall efficiency and adoption rate. The resulting ecosystem of digital assets is under risk of  being fragmented, with non-interoperable dapps and underlying data. 

One of the major problems in the future may not be the technological barrier to issuing ownership rights of different unique assets on the blockchain, but rather the authenticity of issuing entities. Currently there is no mechanism to attest credible NFT issuers. 

### HOW DO WE SOLVE THIS WITH 0xcert?

0xcert is an open source protocol that translates one-of-a-kind digital or real-world assets into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) - unique proof of ownership available from the blockchain.

The vision of 0xcert is to provide an open protocol for standardized and certified non-fungible tokens to a wider tech audience. With 0xcert, you can build on top of the non-fungible token standard, employing a complete toolset, development framework, and a set of conventions for various use cases. This results in shorter development time, lower risk and cuts cost associated with developing blockchain solutions. A wide range of decentralized applications and business models can be supported, giving companies the power to fully utilize the potential of blockchain technology.

### ECOSYSTEM

The purpose of 0xcert is not only to build out a technological layer, but also to unite the community around NFTs. Therefore, we will work with different stakeholders on different levels, ranging from R&D in the 0xcert Labs, further 0xcert protocol development as well as with protocol users and the general NFT space.

PRODUCT - 0xcert protocol 
0xcert is an open-source permissionless protocol for non-fungible tokens on the blockchain.

Conventions and upgraded functionality for non-fungible tokens

Non-fungible tokens built with 0xcert conventions are called Xcerts. Conventions are community-driven standard data inputs and are determined for each asset type. Xcerts represent standard non-fungible tokens, which also hold an imprint of an asset. With the 0xcert protocol, we can further validate proof of existence, authenticity and ownership of these assets without third-party involvement.

Plug & Play framework
 
The framework consists of SDKs in various programing languages, detailed documentation and other developer tools. It is built so that libraries directly interact with the 0xcert protocol and developers can bypass low-level blockchain complexity.

### DEX for fungible and non-fungible tokens
Decentralised exchange is one of the key supporting components in the 0xcert framework. DEX represents a set of smart contracts installed on the blockchain which allow for a trustless exchange of multiple different types of fungible and non-fungible tokens as single atomic operations. Although not all NFTs are meant to be traded (ID, credentials,...), most others (art, collectibles,...) are seeking additional liquidity, which can be provided through an exchange.

### Open source and blockchain agnostic
0xcert is an open-source and community driven project. Its first implementation is built on Ethereum. However, due to the blockchain-agnostic nature of the protocol, expansion to other blockchains will follow (e.g. NEO, Wanchain, EOS,...).


### ZXC TOKEN 
The ZXC token is a protocol token and is introduced to align issuing parties with dapps and the community. The ZXC token is also a part of the extended 0xcert ecosystem that spans beyond the protocol itself. We envision its usage on a few layers, which further decentralize important elements of the corresponding ecosystem.

### Fees
Dapps developed by 0xcert (e.g. KYC and Academia pilot projects), may use the ZXC token as the basic liquid asset for these dapps to operate on the protocol - similar to gas on the Ethereum blockchain. There are also a number of other use cases within dapps that may use ZXC: bidding, granting access, rewards, loyalty programs, staking, etc.

### Decentralised governance
Over time, a decentralized governance may be introduced to further strengthen the 0xcert community. 0xcert aims to be a community driven project - various stakeholders come together to co-create an ecosystem around the protocol itself. In this light, the decentralized governance model may be introduced in the future to drive protocol-level development updates, conventions and update integration. 

### Issuer Verification Registry 
An important piece of the proposed protocol will be authenticating and assuring the validity of issuers building with the 0xcert protocol. Each NFT issued requires a deployed main (Xcert token) contract and a mechanism that will attest the validity and the issuers identity. 

We are proposing a token curated registry to pursue a decentralized approach in validating the issuers of NFTs. Ultimately, a new issuer would stake a portion of tokens to get listed, while the existing holders will have the ability to approve or challenge the listing.
