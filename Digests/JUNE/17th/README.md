Ethtrade (ETHS) - is a decentralized trading platform with an open source code that allows people to store and invest their funds in a currency that is not controlled by the state, and also to receive income from investment, which is backed by the trade of our traders at the crypto exchange.

The basis of our investment trading platform is an Ethereum based smart contract. This is a guarantee of your funds safety, since third parties does not have access to the contract. And all operations are transparent and easy to track in the blockchain:

- Old contract: 0xc99eb107bccB3600FE503C9F4C7D20D2E65Fb800
- New contract: 0x3af70F8772fadd33B18Eb1bDf9475EA727817391

Smart contract acts as a guarantor of the fact that the funds stay safe and no one will steal them.
How everything works: You invest in one of the smart contracts for 2 or 4 months.

Part of the funds (30%) goes to traders who trade on the crypto-exchanges. Thus, they increase profits, which compensates referral deductions and profits that are paid daily.

You can see how traders work in the "For investors" section
The main amount (70%) is on a smart contract and can be withdrawn at any time.

More about our smart contract:

ETHS is a token of a smart contract:

 Funding of this smart contract is programmed in such a way that the participants receive ETHS tokens for their deposit, which are GUARANTEED by their finances.

Thus the number of ETHS tokens is strictly limited by the resources that etht participants will contribute Ethtrade and nothing else.

So, in addition to contributing funds on the contract, users also receive ETHS tokens for: referral deductions (these are bonuses from the deposit of their partners and profits from their contracts daily).

These tokens are tied to the address of your deposit in your account and can be withdrawn on demand:

1) an application for the exchange of crypto-currency has been created in our personal account.

2) sent to another wallet that supports ERC20 tokens (myetherwallet, mist, parity, imToken and others)

3) sent to other exchanges (almost all exchanges support the ERC20 token)

The contract fully supports the referral tree and stores it, as well as stores the funds contributed by users, ensuring the security of the investment by the transparency of our system.
After 2/4 months, depending on the duration of the contract - funds can be requested for withdrawal and withdrawn.

If you want to withdraw funds before the contract end, you can withdraw with a 30% fine.

What we have in the end:

- a real ETHS token,
- which will be traded on crypto-exchanges, since almost all exchanges support the ERC20 token,
- which capitalization is growing due to:

1) company marketing 

2) investors,

3) pays off by traders who trade at 30% of your funds.

4) The growth of prices on crypto-exchanges, as the number of ETHS tokens is limited and supported by real investments.

5) Real use of the token.
 
Plans:

Increasing of professional traders team
