AeriumX utilizes Instant pay technology that allows point-of-sale transactions all whilst maintaining security between the sender and receiver.

Masternodes are incentivized nodes, paid rewards for giving enhanced network security and other services to the AeriumX Network. Running a masternode requires the temporary locking of 1000 AEX as a collateral.

AeriumX is implementing the Zerocoin protocol, setting itself apart as the industry standard in Privacy. The Zerocoin protocol provides definitive privacy for the users of AEX.

60 second block time making for faster transactions.

Using Masternodes to protect the integrity and efficiency of the network.

Empowered community focused initiative - any AEX holder can vote on the future of the project.

The swap from Aerium to AeriumX will be on the 4th of June 2018. All Aerium coin holders have 2 weeks' time to Swap to the new blockchain of AeriumX. Coins which are not Swapping during this time will stay on the old blockchain. There is no way to get them on the new blockchain of AeriumX after the 2-week time frame. Exchanges are not supporting the swap directly, you need to withdraw for participating on the swap. Staking Pools are supporting.

How to swap:

  1. You should download the new wallet below.

  2. Add the BOT https://t.me/aeriumxbot - This official BOT will request from you this new AeriumX address to send you the swapped coins.
 
  3. The BOT will provide you an address to send your old Aerium (AERM) coins. The address is new and generated and its completely safe to send your Aerium (AERM) to this address.

  4. The transaction id will automatically be checked and approved.

  5. You will be notified on the BOT's chat once the swap is completed.
