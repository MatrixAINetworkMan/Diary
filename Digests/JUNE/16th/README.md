## [ANN] Grafium [GRAF] Masternode Privacy Cryptocurrency 

### What is Grafium [GRAF]? 

Grafium is an open source cryptocurrency that focuses on privacy, speed, decentralization and community decisions. 

Grafium uses the QUARK algorithm with POS consensus and Masternodes to create a secure network with full nodes across the globe, this ensures the network is decentralized and no one person has control or ownership. Unlike most other currencies, decisions on Grafium’s future are made by the community.

### FEATURES

##### Masternodes & Staking

Grafium is powered by Masternodes that secure the blockchain and reward the owners with payouts in Grafium. 
The amount of Grafium needed for a masternode is 10,000 coins. Early investors will especially benefit, due to the block
rewards being the highest at the start and decreasing over time. Masternodes can be a source of passive income and are
very easy to set up on a VPS or locally on your computer. If you don't have 10,000 Grafium, you can also help to secure the 
blockchain, as you can stake your coins and earn rewards passively. You will find below in this whitepaper the reward structure
so make sure you take a look. By staking your coins you are contributing to securing the blockchain and it also ensures that 
the barrier for entry is low, because you don't need a masternode to earn passive income with Grafium.


##### Community Focused

Grafium is very community focused. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, the community plays an important role in Grafium’s decisions and the direction of Grafium’s future. We strongly believe that the community will bring Grafium to its full potential. 

##### Privacy

receive securely and privately at any time.

##### Decentralized Network

by the community.


##### VISION

##### MASTERNODES

Masternodes are computers that run the Grafium wallet which provide increased privacy of transactions, instant transactions
and decentralized governance of the blockchain, making decisions. As a result they are rewarded with coins from the blocks
being created. 

Masternodes sit on the blockchain, within a queuing system, when they reach a certain position in this queue
they can be selected at random, to be rewarded for participating within the network. 

Masternodes are required to have 10,000 Grafium collateral, and to run 24 hours a day. In return they are paid 70% of the 
reward of every block, which is distributed to masternodes one at a time.


##### PROOF OF STAKE

Unlike the proof of work system, in which the user validates transactions and creates new blocks by performing a certain 
amount of computational work requiring multiple computers and a lot of resources. For the proof of stake protocol you only
need to run the wallet on one computer, and no matter your computers performance you have the same chance of hitting a
block as everyone else. However the more coins you have the quicker your stake will be. The benefit of proof of stake is that
it results in a higher amount of nodes as anyone can stake on the network, making it more secure than a conventional POW 
based coin which relies on computing power.

With Grafium you will be able to stake on the wallet and in return you will receive 30% of the
reward of every block found, for securing and confirming transactions on the network.
